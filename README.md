## üöÄ Future Vision

This MVP is a solid foundation for a full-featured product. Next steps include:

- **Scalable Backend**  
  - Migrating the core game logic to Firebase Cloud Functions would prevent cheating and secure the API keys.

- **Enhanced Features**  
  - Adding persistent user accounts, a global leaderboard, achievements, and more diverse game modes (e.g., mini-missions, story mode). 

- **Improved User Experience**  
  - Developing a multi-file front-end project to enhance performance and create a more polished UI with smooth animations and transitions.
